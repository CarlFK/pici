#cloud-config

# This is the user-data configuration file for cloud-init. By default this sets
# up an initial user called "ubuntu" with password "ubuntu", which must be
# changed at first login. However, many additional actions can be initiated on
# first boot from this file. The cloud-init documentation has more details:
#
# https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/
#
# Please note that the YAML format employed by this file is sensitive to
# differences in whitespace; if you are editing this file in an editor (like
# Notepad) which uses literal tabs, take care to only use spaces for
# indentation. See the following link for more details:
#
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML
#
# Some additional examples are provided in comments below the default
# configuration.

# On first boot, set the (default) ubuntu user's password to "ubuntu" and
# expire user passwords
# chpasswd:
#  expire: true
#  list:
#  - ubuntu:ubuntu

# Enable password authentication with the SSH daemon
ssh_pwauth: true

## On first boot, use ssh-import-id to give the specific users SSH access to
## the default user
ssh_import_id:
- lp:CarlFK
- gh:mithro

## Add users and groups to the system, and import keys with the ssh-import-id
## utility
#groups:
#- robot: [robot]
#- robotics: [robot]
#- pi
#
users:
- default
- name: robot
  gecos: Mr. Robot
  # primary_group: robot
  groups: users
  ssh_import_id:
  - lp:CarlFK
  - gh:mithro
  lock_passwd: false
  # passwd: $5$hkui88$nvZgIle31cNpryjRfO9uArF7DYiBcWEnjqq7L1AQNN3
  plain_text_passwd: x

## Update apt database and upgrade packages on first boot
#package_update: true
#package_upgrade: true

## Install additional packages on first boot
#packages:
#- pwgen
#- pastebinit
#- [libpython2.7, 2.7.3-0ubuntu3.1]

## Write arbitrary files to the file-system (including binaries!)
#write_files:
#- path: /etc/default/keyboard
